Olimar's Escape, an unfinished, text-based, role-playing game (RPG)

# About
I taught myself C++ in middle school, and this was one of the first significant things I worked on.  It taught me about game programming in particular.. about the game loop, updating on each step, the logic, the story, etc.  I did not finish it though, once I started seeing how arbitrary the story could be, and how the game system could be, and so I stopped working on it I guess, but it's surely a start.
